# Auto MPG Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to predict a car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon - MPG) using multiple features such as engine size, weight, and model year.

This project is part of my learning journey in Machine Learning and focuses on understanding Linear Regression.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Auto MPG Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Description:** Contains technical specifications of cars and their fuel efficiency.

---

## 🧾 Features Used
- Cylinders  
- Displacement  
- Horsepower  
- Weight  
- Acceleration  
- Model Year  
- Origin  

**Target Variable:** MPG (Miles Per Gallon)

---

## 🤖 Model Used
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Library:** scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- **Metric Used:** R² Score  
- **Result:** The model explains a significant portion of variance in MPG.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Vehicle weight has a strong negative impact on fuel efficiency.
- Newer model years show significantly higher MPG.
- Cars from non-US origins tend to have better mileage.
